How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
You can implement user needs into a program and implement them by understanding the needs of the user by allowing the user to describe what they need and then testing for the expected functionality. User Stories help with this because they allow a more apt description of the actual functionality expected which allows for more precise tests to be created.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I can approach developing programs by always keeping modularity and flexibility in mind. Using test driven development will help me deal with programs in this way as it allows me to test for expected outcomes and program to fulfill those expected outcomes.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in any environment is all about communication and mutual respect. To come to any solution on any problem and to work with each persons strengths and weaknesses it requires open and honest communication between everyone which can only happen with mutual respect for everyone on the team.
